# html-first-steps 

  <pre>
  In this repository, I have applied my knowledge and learning to create a simple and basic 
  form that collects information such as first name, middle name, last name, gender, address, 
  pincode, country, and feedback. I have used various HTML elements including <div>, 
  headings (<h1>), paragraphs (<p>), <hr>, <br>, <form>, <input>, <label>, <select>,
  <textarea>, <header>, <main>, and <footer>. While building this form, I discovered and 
  learned a few new things, which I have also implemented here. I plan to incorporate these 
  learnings into my future projects as needed.
